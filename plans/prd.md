# 360 Flatmates Web Application -- PRD and Technical Specification

## Context

The 360 Flatmates mobile app (Flutter) has 27+ screens, 38+ API endpoints, Supabase Auth, real-time SSE, swipe deck, chat, visits, listings, and an 8-step onboarding flow. The web application is a **greenfield project** -- the repo at `360-flatmates-web` contains only an OpenAPI spec file and empty placeholder files. This PRD defines the complete product and technical specification for building a Next.js web app that replicates all mobile features and adds web-specific features (advanced search, saved searches, analytics dashboard, etc.) using the existing backend API.

---

## 1. Product Overview

360 Flatmates Web is a greenfield Next.js web application that mirrors and extends the existing Flutter mobile client. The web app serves two strategic purposes: (a) providing a full-featured authenticated experience for existing mobile users who prefer desktop browsing, and (b) creating a publicly indexable discovery surface for SEO-driven acquisition of new users.

The product combines three user intents under one roof -- finding a co-hunter, advertising a spare room, and being open to either -- powered by a 6-dimension compatibility engine, a swipe-based discovery metaphor adapted for desktop, structured listing templates, rich chat with visit scheduling, and a society insights layer. The web version introduces features that leverage the desktop form factor: advanced multi-filter search panels, saved searches with email/push alerts, a Room Poster analytics dashboard, keyboard-driven swipe navigation, and server-clustered map views.

**Target Market:** Pan-India, young professionals aged 22-32, across Bangalore, Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune, and tier-2 expansion cities.

**Monetization:** None in V1. Freemium UI patterns (boost slots, swipe caps, super-like scarcity) are built in to prepare for V2 paywall introduction.

**Backend:** The web app consumes the same FastAPI monolith backend (`/api/v1`) already serving the Flutter client. No new backend services are required.

## 2. User Personas

### Persona A -- Priya, 26, Bangalore

Software engineer relocating from Chennai. Needs a room in Koramangala or HSR within 2 weeks. Introverted, non-smoker, vegetarian, WFH 3 days. Biggest fear: incompatible flatmate lifestyle. Mode: Co-Hunter / Open to Both. Primary need: compatibility first, location second. On web, Priya uses the advanced search with 25+ filters to shortlist, saves her search, and sets up a daily alert for new Koramangala listings under Rs 25k.

### Persona B -- Arjun, 29, Delhi NCR

Startup employee in a 3BHK in Gurugram, one flatmate moving out. Needs a clean, professional replacement. Has a dog. Mode: Room Poster. Primary need: find a trustworthy person fast. On web, Arjun uses the Room Poster Dashboard to track listing views, likes, and conversations. He shares his listing via the WhatsApp share card and monitors society tag votes.

### Persona C -- Meera and Siddharth, 24 and 25, Mumbai

College friends both starting new jobs. Need a third person. Mode: Co-Hunter (group). Primary need: find a compatible third person. On web, they browse the map view with clustered pins to identify viable localities, then use semantic search ("quiet flatshare near Bandra station under 30k with pet-friendly society") to discover options.

---

## 3. Information Architecture

### 3.1 Public Surface (SEO-indexable, no auth required)

Note: `/explore` renders the map for both public and authenticated users. Unauthenticated users see a limited view (no compatibility scores, auth wall on contact).

| Route | Page | Rendering |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `/` | Landing page | SSG |
| `/discover` | Browse listings (public feed) | SSR + ISR (5min) |
| `/discover/[id]` | Listing detail page | SSR |
| `/search` | Advanced search with 25+ filters | SSR |
| `/search/semantic` | Semantic/vector search | SSR |
| `/stats` | City statistics (cold-start counter) | ISR (15min) |
| `/share/[id]` | Share card (OG image target) | SSR |

### 3.2 Authenticated Surface (auth required)

| Route | Page | Rendering |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `/login` | Phone OTP + Password auth | CSR |
| `/onboarding/*` | Multi-step onboarding flow | CSR |
| `/home` | Personalized home feed | SSR |
| `/swipe` | Swipe deck (desktop-adapted) | CSR |
| `/likes` | Incoming likes | SSR |
| `/chats` | Conversation list | SSR |
| `/chats/[id]` | Chat thread | CSR |
| `/explore` | Map view (public + authenticated) | CSR |
| `/post` | Listing builder (8-step) | CSR |
| `/manage` | Manage listings (Room Poster) | SSR |
| `/dashboard` | Room Poster analytics dashboard | SSR |
| `/visits` | Upcoming/past visits | SSR |
| `/visits/[id]` | Visit detail | SSR |
| `/profile` | Profile view/edit | SSR |
| `/profile/[id]` | Public profile view | SSR |
| `/settings` | App settings | CSR |
| `/notifications` | Notification center | SSR |
| `/saved-searches` | Saved searches CRUD | SSR |
| `/alerts` | Search alerts management | SSR |

### 3.3 Mode-Dependent Navigation

The sidebar navigation adapts per user mode, mirroring the mobile bottom nav:

| Nav Item | Room Poster | Co-Hunter | Open to Both |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Home | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Post / Manage | Yes | -- | -- |
| Explore (Map) | -- | Yes | Yes |
| Swipe | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Likes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Chats | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Dashboard | Yes | -- | -- |
| Profile | Yes | Yes | Yes |

On mobile viewports (< 768px), the sidebar collapses to a bottom navigation bar matching the 5-tab mobile app pattern.

## 4. User Flows

### 4.1 New User Acquisition (Public -> Auth)

1. User lands on `/discover` or `/search` from Google
2. Browses public listings (blurred contact details, limited profile info)
3. Clicks "Contact" or "Like" -> Auth Wall Modal (inline OTP login form, preserves page context)
4. Phone OTP or password login via Supabase Auth
5. If new user: redirect to `/onboarding`
6. Bootstrap: `GET /flatmates/bootstrap` loads profile + catalogs + counts
7. If `onboarding_completed === false`: redirect to onboarding flow
8. After onboarding: redirect to `/home`

### 4.2 Onboarding Flow

Steps 0-7: Splash -> Mode Selection -> Location -> Basic Info -> Profile Photo -> Lifestyle Quiz (6 dimension cards) -> Budget & Timeline -> Preferences & Non-Negotiables -> (Room Poster: redirect to `/post` for listing builder, not an onboarding step) -> Home Feed

Phone Auth occurs at `/login` before onboarding begins. Each step has a single primary CTA, progress indicator, and back navigation. Total time target: under 4 minutes. Onboarding progress is tracked server-side: `onboarding_current_step` field in profile allows resuming from the last completed step on re-entry.

**Detailed step breakdown:**

0. **Splash** (3 slides): Welcome illustration, "Find your vibe" tagline, privacy trust badge
1. **Mode Selection**: Room Poster / Co-Hunter / Open to Both with icons and descriptions
2. **Location Selection**: Popular cities from catalog + GPS detection + search
3. **Basic Info**: Full name, age (18-100), profession
4. **Profile Photo**: Image picker + upload to Supabase `profile-photos` bucket. Client-side compress to max 2MB, auto-crop to 1:1. Preview before upload.
5. **Lifestyle Quiz**: 6 dimension cards -- Sleep Schedule, Cleanliness, Food Habits, Smoking/Drinking, Guests Policy, Work Style -- each with 3-4 option chips
6. **Budget & Timeline**: Budget min/max (range slider ₹5,000-100,000), Move-in timeline (immediate/this_month/next_month/flexible)
7. **Preferences & Non-Negotiables**: Gender preference, 10 non-negotiable chips (food_veg_only, no_smoking, no_drinking, no_overnight_guests, no_pets, gender_female_only, gender_male_only, no_parties, min_tidy, early_riser)

Draft persisted to localStorage (survives tab close). Key: `360-flatmates-onboarding-draft`. On re-entry, prompt user to resume. Clear draft on successful profile submit. On submit: `PUT /flatmates/profile` with all accumulated data, then reload bootstrap.

### 4.3 Swipe Flow (Desktop-Adapted)

1. User navigates to `/swipe`
2. `GET /flatmates/profiles` fetches swipe deck (with city/budget filters)
3. Swipe deck renders collapsed cards in a central panel (max-width 480px)
4. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Left arrow = Pass, Right arrow = Like, Up arrow = Super Like, Space = expand card
5. **Mouse**: Click action bar buttons (Pass / Super Like / Like), or click-and-drag card with snap-back animation
6. Click card body -> expanded view in right-panel drawer (desktop) or full-screen overlay (tablet/mobile)
7. Expanded view shows: Society info, Room details, Flat config, Costs, About Me, Society Insights, Compatibility Breakdown
8. Swipe action fires `POST /flatmates/swipes` (target_type=user)
9. `POST /flatmates/profile-views` records view analytics (duration, scroll depth)
10. On mutual match: match celebration modal (confetti animation) + Q&A nudge -> opens chat thread
11. Super-like: 3/day cap, 429 on limit exceeded
12. Empty deck: illustrated empty state with "Check back later" message

### 4.4 Search and Save Flow (Web-Specific)

1. User navigates to `/search`
2. Multi-panel filter sidebar: location, budget, room type, furnishing, gender, move-in, amenities, society type, society vibe tags, sharing type
3. Results update with URL-driven state (sharable search URLs via nuqs)
4. `GET /flatmates/web/search` with 25+ filter parameters, search_type (listings/profiles/all), sort_by (includes match_percentage)
5. "Save this search" -> modal for name + alert settings (frequency: instant/daily/weekly, channels: email/push/in_app) -> `POST /flatmates/web/saved-searches`
6. Saved searches accessible from `/saved-searches` with re-run and alert toggle
7. Search alerts at `/alerts` with CRUD management

### 4.5 Chat and Visit Scheduling

1. User enters `/chats` (split layout on desktop: conversation list left, thread right)
2. Two tabs on conversation list: Likes (grid of incoming likes with Match button) + Chats (list of conversation cards)
3. Select conversation -> `/chats/[id]`
4. Q&A answers displayed if both parties completed (collapsible)
5. Match context card pinned at top (property photo, mode, locality, rent)
6. Icebreaker suggestions and Q&A nudge in pre-message area
7. Real-time messages via SSE (`/flatmates/sse`) with 5-second polling fallback
8. Message types: text, image (upload to Supabase `chat-photos` bucket), visit_request
9. Schedule Visit: Calendar date picker (up to 90 days) + time slot chips (Morning/Afternoon/Evening) + optional note -> `POST /visits` + sends chat message with `message_type=visit_request`
10. Visit request card renders in chat thread with Confirm/Reschedule/Cancel actions
11. Auto mark-as-read on conversation enter: `POST /flatmates/conversations/{id}/mark-read`
12. Block/Report available from chat header menu
13. Q&A submission: `POST /flatmates/conversations/{id}/qna`

### 4.6 Listing Management Flow (Room Poster)

1. Create listing: `/post` -> 8-step wizard
   - Step 0: Location (society name, address, city, locality)
   - Step 1: Society (type: gated/standalone, amenities, vibe tags)
   - Step 2-3: Room (type: private/shared, furnishing, features, photo upload 2-10 to Supabase `listing-photos` bucket, video tour URL)
   - Step 4: Flat (config 1-4BHK, floor, total floors, amenities)
   - Step 5: Costs (monthly rent, security deposit, maintenance, electricity, cook/maid/setup costs, total monthly outflow calc)
   - Step 6: About (typical day description, gender preference, age range 18-40, non-negotiables, available from date)
   - Step 7: Review (summary of all data, jump back to any step)
2. `POST /properties` -> listing enters 24hr review (AI pre-screen runs first)
3. Navigate to listing review page: status (pending_review/rejected), 3-step progress indicator, "What happens next" steps
4. SSE `listing_status_changed` event auto-refreshes status
5. Manage listings at `/manage`: segmented tabs (Active/Pending/Drafts/Paused/Expired) with Pause/Resume, Share, Edit, View Stats, Renew actions. Rejected listings visible inside Expired tab with a "Rejected" badge.

## 8. State Management Strategy

### 8.1 Server State -- TanStack Query v5

All API data flows through TanStack Query. Query keys follow a structured pattern:

```
['bootstrap']
['profile']
['catalogs']
['listings', filters]
['listing', id]
['profiles', filters]
['matches']
['conversations']
['conversation', id]
['messages', conversationId, params]
['likes', params]
['visits', params]
['notifications']
['saved-searches']
['search-alerts']
['web-search', filters]
['map-view', params]
['city-stats', city?]
['listing-analytics', id, period]
['dashboard']
['compatibility', userId]
['blocks']
```

**Mutation patterns:**
- Optimistic updates for: swipe actions, message send, visit scheduling, block/report
- Cache invalidation on success: after profile update invalidate `['profile']`, after listing create invalidate `['listings']`, after message send invalidate `['messages', conversationId]` and `['conversations']`
- Infinite queries for: messages (cursor-based), listings (page-based), search results (page-based)

**Stale times:**
- Bootstrap/catalogs: 30 minutes
- Profile: 5 minutes
- Conversations/messages: 0 (always fresh)
- Listings/search: 2 minutes
- City stats: 15 minutes

### 8.2 Client UI State -- Zustand

Small, focused stores for ephemeral UI state only:

| Store | State |
|-------|-------|
| `useAuthStore` | `user`, `session`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading` |
| `useOnboardingStore` | `currentStep`, `draftData`, `isSubmitting`, `resumedStep` |
| `useSwipeStore` | `currentIndex`, `deck`, `isExpanded`, `isAnimating` |
| `useChatStore` | `activeConversationId`, `isTyping`, `sseConnected` |
| `useUIStore` | `sidebarOpen`, `theme`, `palette`, `locale`, `activeModal` |
| `useMapStore` | `center`, `zoom`, `bounds`, `selectedPin`, `filters` |
| `useSearchStore` | `filters`, `sortBy`, `searchType`, `savedSearchName` |

### 8.3 Form State -- React Hook Form + Zod

All multi-step forms use React Hook Form with Zod schemas for validation:

- Onboarding form (7+ steps)
- Listing builder (8 steps)
- Profile edit form
- Visit scheduling form
- Saved search create/edit form
- Report/block forms
- Q&A answer form

Zod schemas are shared between client validation and API type generation (via openapi-typescript).

### 8.4 URL State -- nuqs

Search and filter parameters are synced to URL query parameters using nuqs:

- `/search?q=&city=&price_min=&price_max=&sharing_type=&move_in=&amenities=&sort_by=&page=`
- `/discover?city=&locality=&vibe=&move_in=`
- `/chats/[id]?before=`

This enables deep linking, browser back/forward, and shareable search URLs.

---

## 9. Real-time Strategy

### 9.1 SSE for Event Streaming

The web app uses Server-Sent Events (`GET /flatmates/sse?token={access_token}`) as the primary real-time channel, not Supabase Realtime (which the mobile app uses). SSE is simpler for web, works through proxies, and does not require WebSocket connections. Since SSE does not support custom headers, the Bearer token is passed as a query parameter. Connection uses `EventSource` polyfill with query param auth. Token refreshed on rotation by closing and reconnecting SSE.

**SSE Event Types:**
- `new_match` -- refresh matches list, show toast
- `new_message` -- append to active chat if conversation is open, otherwise increment unread badge
- `conversation_updated` -- refresh conversation list
- `visit_updated` -- refresh visit detail if viewing, update visit card in chat
- `listing_status_changed` -- refresh managed listings
- `new_notification` -- increment notification badge, show toast

### 9.2 Connection Management

- SSE connection established after successful auth
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s)
- Connection status tracked in `useChatStore.sseConnected`
- Visual indicator when real-time is disconnected
- On reconnect: invalidate relevant TanStack Query caches to catch up
- **Multi-tab deduplication**: SSE connection managed via `BroadcastChannel` API. Primary tab holds the SSE connection; secondary tabs receive events via the channel. On primary tab close, next tab establishes SSE. Prevents duplicate connections and 503 "too many subscribers" errors.

### 9.3 Chat Fallback

If SSE is unavailable (503 response, connection timeout > 10s), fall back to 5-second polling:
- `GET /flatmates/conversations/{id}/messages?before={lastMessageId}` on active chat
- `GET /flatmates/conversations` for conversation list refresh
- Polling interval: 5 seconds for active chat, 15 seconds for conversation list

### 9.4 Optimistic Message Send

On message send:
1. Optimistically add message to TanStack Query cache with temp ID
2. `POST /flatmates/conversations/{id}/messages`
3. On success: replace temp message with server response
4. On failure: mark message as failed, show retry button

---

## 10. SEO Strategy

### 10.1 Public Content Indexing

Seven pages are fully indexable by search engines:

| Page | Meta Title Pattern | OG Image |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Landing | "360 Flatmates -- Find Your Flatmate, Find Your Vibe" | Hero illustration |
| Discover | "Browse Flatmate Listings in [City] -- 360 Flatmates" | City-specific |
| Listing Detail | "[Title] in [Locality], [City] -- ₹[Rent]/mo -- 360 Flatmates" | Listing main image |
| Search | "Search Flatmates & Rooms in [City] -- 360 Flatmates" | Search-specific |
| Semantic Search | "Find Flatmates by Lifestyle Match -- 360 Flatmates" | Generic |
| City Stats | "[City] Flatmate Market: [X] Active Seekers -- 360 Flatmates" | City-specific |
| Share Card | "Room Available in [Locality] -- ₹[Rent]/mo -- 360 Flatmates" | Server-generated share card |

### 10.2 Technical SEO

- **Next.js Metadata API**: `generateMetadata()` on all SSR/SSG pages with dynamic titles, descriptions, OG tags, Twitter cards
- **JSON-LD Structured Data**: `RealEstateListing` schema on listing detail pages, `BreadcrumbList` on all pages, `FAQPage` on landing
- **Sitemap.xml**: Dynamic sitemap generated from `GET /properties?property_type=flatmate&limit=1000` + city pages, regenerated every 24 hours via `next-sitemap`
- **Robots.txt**: Allow all public routes, disallow `/api/`, `/chats/`, `/swipe/`, `/onboarding/`, `/admin/`
- **Canonical URLs**: Set on all pages, trailing slash normalization
- **Core Web Vitals targets**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- **Image optimization**: Next.js `<Image>` with AVIF/WebP, responsive srcsets, blur placeholders
- **Font loading**: `next/font/google` for Fraunces (variable), Inter, JetBrains Mono, Instrument Serif with `display: swap` and subset preload

### 10.3 ISR Configuration

| Route | Revalidation |
|-------|-------------|
| `/discover` | 5 minutes |
| `/discover/[id]` | 10 minutes (on-demand revalidation on listing update) |
| `/stats` | 15 minutes |
| `/` (landing) | 24 hours |

On-demand revalidation: when a listing is approved, updated, or paused, trigger `revalidatePath('/discover/[id]')` and `revalidatePath('/discover')` from the admin moderation action.

---

## 11. Performance Strategy

### 11.1 Rendering Strategy Per Page

| Route | Strategy | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| `/` | SSG | Stable content, infrequent updates |
| `/discover` | SSR + ISR 5min | Fresh content, SEO-critical |
| `/discover/[id]` | SSR | Dynamic listing data, SEO-critical |
| `/search` | SSR | SEO-critical, URL-driven |
| `/stats` | ISR 15min | Slowly changing data |
| `/login` | CSR | No SEO need, interactive |
| `/onboarding/*` | CSR | Interactive multi-step form |
| `/home` | SSR | Personalized but cacheable per-user |
| `/swipe` | CSR | Highly interactive, no SEO |
| `/likes` | SSR | Personalized, refreshable |
| `/chats` | SSR | Personalized, refreshable |
| `/chats/[id]` | CSR | Highly interactive, real-time |
| `/explore` | CSR | Map is client-side interactive |
| `/post` | CSR | Complex form, no SEO |
| `/manage` | SSR | Personalized, refreshable |
| `/dashboard` | SSR | Personalized analytics |
| `/visits` | SSR | Personalized, refreshable |
| `/profile` | SSR | Personalized, refreshable |
| `/settings` | CSR | Interactive, no SEO |
| `/notifications` | SSR | Personalized, refreshable |
| `/saved-searches` | SSR | Personalized, refreshable |
| `/alerts` | SSR | Personalized, refreshable |
| `/post/review` | CSR | Interactive status polling |
| `/profile/[id]` | SSR | SEO for public profiles |
| `/settings/blocked-users` | CSR | Interactive, no SEO |
| `/settings/notifications` | CSR | Interactive, no SEO |
| `/terms` | SSG | Stable legal content |
| `/privacy` | SSG | Stable legal content |
| `/about` | SSG | Stable content |
| `/forgot-password` | CSR | Interactive, no SEO |
| `/not-found` | Static | Error page |
| `/error` | Static | Error page |
| `/maintenance` | Static | Error page |

### 11.2 Bundle Optimization

- **React Server Components**: Use RSC for all SSR/SSG pages; data fetching in server components eliminates client-side waterfalls
- **Code splitting**: Each route is a separate chunk; heavy components (Map, SwipeDeck, ChatThread) are lazy-loaded
- **Tree shaking**: Import only used icons from `lucide-react`; barrel imports banned
- **Dynamic imports**: `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` for map components, swipe deck, and chat input
- **Critical CSS**: Tailwind purge ensures only used utilities ship; custom CSS modules for component-specific styles
- **Image optimization**: `next/image` with `sizes` prop, AVIF/WebP, blur placeholder data URLs
- **Font subsetting**: Google Fonts loaded via `next/font/google` with automatic subsetting and preloading
- **Target budget**: Initial JS < 150KB per route, total page weight < 500KB

### 11.3 Caching Strategy

| Layer | TTL | Key |
|-------|-----|-----|
| TanStack Query (browser) | Per-query staleTime | Structured query key |
| Next.js Data Cache | ISR revalidation period | Route + params |
| CDN (Vercel/Cloudflare) | 5min-24hr per route | URL + headers |
| Browser HTTP cache | 60s for API, 1yr for static | Cache-Control headers |
| Service Worker (future) | Offline-first for static assets | Precache manifest |

---

## 12. Authentication Architecture

### 12.1 Supabase Auth Integration

The web app uses `@supabase/supabase-js` for authentication:

- **Phone OTP**: `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ phone })` -> 6-digit SMS -> `supabase.auth.verifyOtp({ phone, token, type: 'sms' })`
- **Password**: `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ phone, password })`
- **Session management**: `supabase.auth.getSession()` returns JWT access token + refresh token
- **Token refresh**: Supabase JS SDK handles auto-refresh; `onAuthStateChange` listener updates Zustand auth store

### 12.2 Auth Middleware Flow

Next.js middleware (`middleware.ts`) runs on every request:

1. Check for Supabase session cookie
2. If no session and route requires auth: show Auth Wall Modal (inline OTP login) or redirect to `/login?redirect={pathname}` for full-page auth
3. If session exists, validate with `supabase.auth.getUser()`
4. If token expired: attempt refresh via `supabase.auth.refreshSession()`
5. If refresh fails: clear session, redirect to `/login`
6. Inject user ID and token into request headers for RSC data fetching

### 12.3 Auth-Protected API Calls

- **Server components**: Use Supabase server client with cookie-based session for RSC data fetching
- **Client components**: Access token from Zustand auth store, passed as `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
- **API client interceptor**: Fetch wrapper that:
  1. Attaches Bearer token from auth store
  2. On 401 response: attempt token refresh
  3. On successful refresh: retry original request
  4. On refresh failure: clear session, redirect to `/login`
  5. Queue concurrent requests during refresh to prevent race conditions

### 12.4 Route Protection Matrix

| Route | Auth Required | Onboarding Required |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| `/`, `/discover/*`, `/search/*`, `/stats`, `/share/*` | No | No |
| `/login` | No (redirect if authenticated) | -- |
| `/onboarding/*` | Yes | No (redirect to `/home` if complete) |
| All other authenticated routes | Yes | Yes (redirect to `/onboarding` if incomplete) |

## 13. API Integration Layer

### 13.1 API Client Architecture

```
lib/
  api/
    client.ts              -- Fetch wrapper with auth interceptor, base URL, error mapping
    types.ts               -- Auto-generated from OpenAPI spec via openapi-typescript
    queries/               -- TanStack Query hook definitions per domain
      auth.ts

      conversations.ts
      visits.ts
      listings.ts
      notifications.ts
      blocks-reports.ts
      interactions.ts
      web-discovery.ts
      admin.ts

      listings.ts
      profile.ts
      blocks-reports.ts
      saved-searches.ts
      alerts.ts
```

### 13.2 Type Generation

Run `openapi-typescript docs/flatmates-openapi.yaml -o lib/api/types.ts` to generate TypeScript types from the OpenAPI spec. All API response/request types derive from this generated file. Manual overrides go in `lib/api/types.override.ts`.

### 13.3 Error Handling in API Layer

API errors map to a typed error hierarchy:

```typescript
type AppError =
  | { type: 'network'; message: string }
  | { type: 'auth'; message: string }
  | { type: 'server'; status: number; message: string }
  | { type: 'not_found'; message: string }
  | { type: 'validation'; fields: Record<string, string[]>; message: string }
  | { type: 'rate_limit'; message: string; retryAfter?: number }
  | { type: 'conflict'; message: string }
  | { type: 'unknown'; message: string }
```

### 13.4 Rate Limiting

| Endpoint Group | Rate Limit | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Search | 30/min | Prevents scraping |
| Swipes | 100/min | Prevents bot swiping |
| Messages | 30/min | Prevents spam |
| Profile views | 60/min | Prevents scraping |
| General API | 120/min | Default for all other endpoints |
| Super-likes | 3/day | Hard cap, 429 on exceed |

Client-side handling: TanStack Query retry with exponential backoff on 429. UI shows Toast "Too many requests. Please wait a moment." on rate limit errors.

### 13.5 Endpoint Map (43 endpoints)

| Tag | Endpoints | Auth |
|-----|-----------|------|

### 13.6 Public Endpoints (No Auth Required)

These are critical for SEO and the public discovery surface:

- `GET /properties` -- Browse listings (with `property_type=flatmate`)
- `GET /properties/semantic-search` -- Semantic vector search
- `GET /properties/{id}` -- Listing detail (non-live listings visible to owner/admin only)
- `GET /flatmates/web/search` -- Web-optimized search with 25+ filters
- `GET /flatmates/web/map` -- Server-clustered map data
- `GET /flatmates/web/stats` -- City statistics
- `GET /flatmates/web/listings/{id}/share-card` -- Share card image generation

## 14. Form Handling

### 14.1 React Hook Form + Zod Pattern

All forms follow this architecture:

```typescript
// 1. Zod schema (co-located with form or in schemas/ directory)
const listingStep1Schema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(5).max(200),
  locality: z.string().min(1),
  monthly_rent: z.number().min(500),
});

// 2. React Hook Form with Zod resolver
const form = useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(listingStep1Schema),
  defaultValues: savedDraft ?? {},
});

// 3. Submission handler with TanStack Query mutation
const mutation = useMutation({ ... });
const onSubmit = (data) => mutation.mutate(data);
```

### 14.2 Multi-Step Form State

The listing builder and onboarding flow use a multi-step pattern:

- Step-level Zod schemas validate only the current step
- Draft data persisted to `localStorage` on each step transition (survives tab close)
- `useForm` with `mode: 'onBlur'` for field-level validation
- Final review step aggregates all step data and validates against the full schema
- Navigation: "Next" validates current step, "Back" preserves data, "Save Draft" persists to localStorage
- Draft keys: `360-flatmates-onboarding-draft` (onboarding), `360-flatmates-listing-draft` (listing builder)

### 14.3 Form Fields per Feature

| Form | Steps | Key Fields |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Onboarding | 8 | Name, age, profession, city, photo, 6 lifestyle dimension cards, budget range, move-in timeline, preferences & non-negotiables |
| Listing Builder | 8 | Location, society, room, photos/video, flat, costs, about/preferred flatmate, review |
| Profile Edit | 1 | All FlatmatesProfileUpdate fields |
| Visit Schedule | 1 | Date, time slot, note |
| Saved Search Create | 1 | Name, filter config, alert settings |
| Report | 1 | Reason, optional notes |
| Q&A Answers | 1 | 3 free-text/scale answers |

## 15. Accessibility Requirements

### 15.1 WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

- **Color contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (verified against the ink-on-paper palette)
- **Color-only information**: Never convey state by color alone; always pair with icons, text labels, or patterns
- **Touch/click targets**: Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements
- **Focus indicators**: Visible focus ring on all interactive elements; 2px solid terracotta outline with 2px offset
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard operability for all interactive components; logical tab order; focus trap in modals/drawers
- **Screen reader support**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels on all interactive elements, `aria-live` regions for dynamic content (new messages, notifications, toast announcements)
- **Reduced motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; disable animations, simplify transitions, remove confetti effects

### 15.2 Specific Component Accessibility

| Component | ARIA Pattern |
|-----------|-------------|
| Swipe deck | `role="region"` with `aria-label="Profile cards"`, arrow key instructions |
| Chat thread | `role="log"` with `aria-live="polite"` for new messages |
| Filter chips | `role="group"` with `aria-label`, chips as `role="checkbox"` |
| Modal/Drawer | Focus trap, `aria-modal="true"`, `role="dialog"` |
| Tab navigation | `role="tablist"` / `role="tab"` / `role="tabpanel"` |
| Toast | `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"` |
| Progress ring | `role="progressbar"` with `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax` |

### 15.3 Localization Support

- English and Hindi (matching mobile app)
- `next-intl` for i18n routing (`/en/`, `/hi/`)
- Default locale: English
- All user-facing strings extracted to message catalogs
- RTL not required (Hindi is LTR)

## 16. Error Handling Strategy

### 16.1 Error Hierarchy

```
AppError (base)
  |-- NetworkError          -- No connectivity, timeout, DNS failure
  |-- AuthError             -- 401, expired token, refresh failure
  |-- ServerError           -- 5xx with status code
  |-- NotFoundError         -- 404
  |-- ValidationError       -- 422 with field-level errors
  |-- RateLimitError        -- 429 with retry-after
  |-- ConflictError         -- 409 (duplicate action)
  |-- ForbiddenError        -- 403 (insufficient permissions)
  |-- UnknownError          -- Unmapped errors
```

### 16.2 Error Surfaces

| Surface | Component | Behavior |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Page-level (SSR) | `error.tsx` boundary | Full-page error with retry, back navigation, and status code |
| Page-level (CSR) | React Error Boundary | Error card with retry button, 200ms fade-in + slide-up animation |
| List/Grid empty | `EmptyState` component | Illustration + message + optional CTA, breathing icon animation |
| List/Grid loading | `Skeleton` component | Shimmer gradient placeholders (card/list/feed/profile variants) |
| API mutation failure | Toast notification | Error message with "Retry" action, auto-dismiss after 8s |
| Form field error | Inline below field | Red text with error icon, scroll to first error on submit |
| Network offline | Banner overlay | Persistent "You are offline" banner at top of viewport |
| Auth expired | Redirect to `/login` | Preserves redirect target, shows "Session expired" message |
| SSE disconnect | Subtle indicator | Small icon in chat header indicating "Messages may be delayed" |

### 16.3 Banned Patterns

- No `error.toString()` or `err.message` direct display in UI
- No generic "Something went wrong" without contextual retry action
- No swallowing errors silently (always log to console in dev, analytics in prod)
- No `any` type for error objects

---

## 17. Analytics Events

### 17.1 Event Taxonomy

All events follow `object_action` naming with a consistent property schema:

| Event | Properties |
|-------|-----------|
| `page_viewed` | `page`, `referrer`, `auth_status`, `mode` |
| `listing_viewed` | `listing_id`, `source` (discover/search/map/swipe), `auth_status` |
| `listing_shared` | `listing_id`, `channel` (whatsapp/instagram/link) |
| `search_executed` | `query`, `filters_applied`, `result_count`, `search_type` |
| `search_saved` | `search_id`, `alert_enabled`, `alert_frequency` |
| `swipe_actioned` | `target_type`, `action`, `target_id`, `match_percentage`, `source` (keyboard/mouse/touch) |
| `profile_expanded` | `target_user_id`, `duration_seconds`, `scroll_depth`, `source` |
| `match_created` | `match_id`, `conversation_id`, `target_user_id`, `match_percentage` |
| `qna_completed` | `conversation_id`, `both_answered` |
| `message_sent` | `conversation_id`, `message_type`, `is_first_message` |
| `visit_scheduled` | `visit_id`, `conversation_id`, `context` |
| `visit_confirmed` | `visit_id`, `days_until_visit` |
| `listing_created` | `listing_id`, `steps_completed`, `time_spent_seconds` |
| `listing_published` | `listing_id` |
| `login_completed` | `method` (otp/password), `is_new_user` |
| `onboarding_completed` | `mode`, `total_time_seconds`, `steps_completed` |
| `filter_applied` | `filter_name`, `filter_value`, `page` |
| `alert_created` | `alert_id`, `frequency`, `channels` |
| `society_tag_voted` | `listing_id`, `tag`, `vote` |
| `error_occurred` | `error_type`, `error_code`, `page`, `context` |

### 17.2 Analytics Implementation

- `PostHog` for product analytics (event capture, session replay, feature flags)
- `Sentry` for error tracking and performance monitoring
- Analytics wrapper utility in `lib/analytics/` with typed event tracking
- Server-side page views tracked via Next.js middleware
- Client-side events tracked via `useEffect` + router events

## 21. Web-Specific UX Decisions

### 21.1 Swipe Deck on Desktop

The mobile swipe deck uses a card-stack with drag-to-swipe physics. On desktop, the interaction model adapts:

- **Primary card**: Centered in viewport (max-width 480px) on a neutral paper background
- **Keyboard controls**: Left arrow = Pass, Right arrow = Like, Up arrow = Super Like, Space = expand card, Escape = dismiss expanded view, Tab = navigate action bar buttons
- **Mouse controls**: Click action bar buttons, or click-and-drag card with snap-back animation (max 15 degrees rotation, threshold 20% of card width)
- **Expanded view**: Opens as a right-side drawer panel (desktop) or full-screen overlay (tablet/mobile), showing full profile with sections (Society, Room, Flat, Costs, About Me, Society Insights, Compatibility Breakdown)
- **Card count indicator**: "3 of 12 remaining" shown below the deck
- **Empty deck state**: Illustrated empty state with "Check back later for new profiles" message

### 21.2 Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width | Layout |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Mobile | < 768px | Bottom nav (5 tabs), full-screen pages, stacked layout |
| Tablet | 768-1023px | Collapsed sidebar (64px icons only), two-column where applicable |
| Desktop | 1024-1439px | Sidebar nav (240px), content area, expanded drawer |
| Wide | >= 1440px | Sidebar nav (280px), content area with max-width 1200px, side panels |

### 21.3 Sidebar Navigation (Desktop)

- **Room Poster**: Home | Post & Manage | Swipe | Likes | Chats | Dashboard | Profile
- **Co-Hunter / Open to Both**: Home | Explore | Swipe | Likes | Chats | Profile
- Collapsible to icon-only mode (64px width) on toggle
- Active item: terracotta text + icon, terracotta `primary/14` background
- Logo at top: "360 FLATMATES" in compact mode
- User avatar + name + mode badge at bottom, links to profile

### 21.4 Chat Thread Desktop Layout

On desktop (>= 1024px), chats use a split layout:
- **Left panel** (320px): Conversation list with search, unread badges
- **Right panel** (flex): Active chat thread with match context card, messages, input

On mobile, conversation list and chat thread are separate routes.

### 21.5 Search Panel Desktop Layout

On desktop, the search page uses a three-panel layout:
- **Left sidebar** (280px): Filter panel with all 25+ filters, collapsible sections
- **Center**: Search results grid (2-3 columns of listing cards)
- **Right** (optional): Map preview panel (toggleable)

On mobile, filters collapse into a bottom sheet, results are single-column.

### 21.6 Map View Adaptation

- Mobile uses Flutter Map with client-side clustering
- Web uses `@react-google-maps/api` or `vis.gl/react-google-maps` with server-clustered data from `GET /flatmates/web/map`
- Cluster markers: colored circles with count (orange = Room Available, blue = Co-Hunter)
- Click cluster: zoom in and reveal sub-clusters/pins
- Click pin: info window with mini-card (photo, title, rent, compatibility %, "View" CTA)
- Filter bar above map: budget range, sharing type, move-in timeline
- Zoom level sent to API for cluster granularity control

### 21.7 Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

| Shortcut | Context | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `Left` | Swipe deck | Pass |
| `Right` | Swipe deck | Like |
| `Up` | Swipe deck | Super Like |
| `Space` | Swipe deck | Expand current card |
| `Esc` | Any overlay | Dismiss/close |
| `/` | Any page | Focus search bar |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+K` | Any page | Open command palette (stretch) |
| `Enter` | Chat input | Send message |
| `Shift+Enter` | Chat input | New line |

### 21.8 Dark Mode and Theme Switching

- **CSS custom properties** for all design tokens, switched via `[data-theme="dark"]` attribute on `<html>`
- **Tailwind dark mode**: `darkMode: 'class'` strategy
- **Three palettes** (matching mobile): default (terracotta/coral), ember, monsoon teal
- System preference detection via `prefers-color-scheme`
- Theme persisted in localStorage, synced to Zustand UI store
- Dark mode tokens: warm charcoal scaffold (`#1A1612`), dark surface (`#2A2520`), elevated surface (`#342E28`), lightened ink text, reduced shadows, slightly increased border alpha

### 21.9 Touch and Pointer Interactions

- **Press feedback**: All interactive elements scale to 0.97 on `pointerdown` (CSS `:active` + `transition: transform 150ms ease-out`)
- **Hover states**: Desktop-only hover effects (card lift, shadow deepen, border glow) that do not appear on touch devices
- **Selection spring**: Filter chips scale to 1.03 on selection with `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` (easeOutBack)
- **Focus glow**: Search bar and focused inputs gain terracotta box-shadow + subtle 1.01 scale
- **Drag-to-swipe**: Pointer events for card drag with physics (rotation proportional to horizontal offset, shadow deepens on lift)

### 21.10 Mouse-First vs Touch-First Decisions

| Component | Desktop (Mouse) | Mobile (Touch) |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Swipe actions | Keyboard + drag + action bar buttons | Swipe gesture + action bar buttons |
| Expanded profile | Right-side drawer | Full-screen overlay |
| Filters | Left sidebar panel | Bottom sheet |
| Navigation | Persistent sidebar | Bottom tab bar |
| Chat layout | Split view (list + thread) | Separate routes |
| Map interactions | Hover info windows, scroll zoom | Tap pins, pinch zoom |
| Context menus | Right-click menus (stretch) | Long-press (stretch) |
| Tooltips | Hover tooltips on info icons | Tap to reveal |

---

## 22. Terminology Glossary

User-facing and technical terms map as follows:

| User-Facing | API / Technical | OpenAPI Schema |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Listing | Property | Property, PropertyCreate |
| Flatmate | Profile | FlatmatesProfile |
| Save | Like (swipe action) | SwipeRequest.action=like |
| Mode | FlatmatesMode | room_poster, co_hunter, open_to_both |
| Society Type | society_type | gated, independent, co_living, pg |
| Room Type | sharing_type | private_room, shared_room, master_bedroom, entire_flat |
| Gender Preference | gender_preference | male, female, any |
| Visit Context | context | property_tour, flatmate_meet |

**Convention**: Use "listing" in all user-facing UI/UX text. Use "property" in API/technical PRD sections, code, and endpoint paths.

---

## 23. Security Headers

Next.js middleware sets the following security headers on all responses:

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Content-Security-Policy | `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' blob: data: https://*.supabase.co https://*.googleapis.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co https://*.posthog.com https://*.sentry.io wss://*.supabase.co; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; frame-ancestors 'none'` | Prevent XSS, data injection |
| X-Frame-Options | DENY | Prevent clickjacking |
| X-Content-Type-Options | nosniff | Prevent MIME sniffing |
| Strict-Transport-Security | max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload | Force HTTPS |
| Referrer-Policy | strict-origin-when-cross-origin | Limit referrer leakage |
| Permissions-Policy | camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(self) | Limit browser API access |

---

## 24. CORS Specification

The web app (frontend) calls a separate FastAPI backend. CORS configuration:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Allowed Origins (Production) | `https://360flatmates.com`, `https://flatmates.360ghar.com` |
| Allowed Origins (Development) | `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:3001` |
| Allowed Methods | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS |
| Allowed Headers | Authorization, Content-Type, X-Request-ID |
| Credentials | true |
| Max Age | 86400 (preflight cache) |

---

## 25. CI/CD Pipeline

### 25.1 GitHub Actions CI

On every pull request:
- **Lint**: ESLint with zero warnings
- **Type-check**: `tsc --noEmit`
- **Unit tests**: Vitest with coverage threshold (>70%)
- **Build**: `next build` succeeds
- **Lighthouse CI**: Performance budget (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1)

### 25.2 Deployment

- **Preview**: Per-PR deployment on Vercel preview URL
- **Production**: Deploy on merge to `main` branch
- **Branch naming**: `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`
- **On-demand revalidation**: Webhook from FastAPI on listing status change triggers `revalidatePath()`

### 25.3 Environment Strategy

| Environment | API Base URL | Supabase Project |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Local | `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` | Dev project |
| Preview | `https://staging-api.360ghar.com/api/v1` | Staging project |
| Production | `https://api.360ghar.com/api/v1` | Production project |

---

## 26. Search Debouncing

| Input Type | Debounce | Rationale |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Search text input | 300ms | Fast enough to feel responsive, avoids excessive API calls |
| Filter changes | Immediate | URL sync is cheap; API call fires immediately |
| Semantic search | 500ms | Heavier vector search, needs longer debounce |

---

## Appendix A: Design Token Mapping (Mobile -> Web)

All color tokens, typography, border radii, spacing, shadows, gradients, frost effects, and animation durations from the mobile `DESIGN.md` map directly to CSS custom properties in the web app. Key mappings:

- **Colors**: Direct hex/rgba values as CSS custom properties on `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]`
- **Typography**: `next/font/google` loads Fraunces (variable), Inter, JetBrains Mono, Instrument Serif; Tailwind `theme.extend.fontFamily` maps to CSS variables; Fraunces variable settings (`opsz`, `SOFT`, `WONK`) applied via `font-variation-settings` utility class
- **Border radius**: Tailwind `theme.extend.borderRadius` with design token names
- **Spacing**: Tailwind `theme.extend.spacing` with design token names
- **Shadows**: Tailwind `theme.extend.boxShadow` with design token names (warm ink tints, terracotta-tinted CTA shadows)
- **Animation**: Tailwind `theme.extend.transitionDuration` and `theme.extend.animation` with design token names from the mobile animation guidelines
- **Frost/Glassmorphism**: `backdrop-filter: blur(3px)` + semi-transparent background

## Appendix B: Compatibility Engine (Web Implementation)

The 6-dimension weighted scoring engine runs identically on web as on mobile:

| Dimension | Weight | Scoring |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Sleep Schedule | 20% | Exact match = 100, Adjacent = 50, Opposite = 0 |
| Cleanliness | 20% | 0 gap = 100, 1 gap = 50, 2 gap = 0 |
| Food Habits | 15% | Veg/Vegan strict match = 100, Non-veg + non-veg = 100, Mismatch with strict veg = 0 |
| Smoking/Drinking | 20% | Non-smoker + non-smoker = 100, One smokes = 30, Both = 100 |
| Guests Policy | 15% | Exact match = 100, One step apart = 60, Two steps = 20 |
| Work Style | 10% | WFH + WFH = 100, Office + Office = 100, Mixed = 70 |

Result: single percentage + color (green >= 70%, amber 40-69%, red < 40%) + per-dimension breakdown with match/mismatch indicators.

Client-side calculation from cached profile data. No server call per swipe. The server endpoint `GET /flatmates/web/compatibility/{user_id}` is used for the dedicated compatibility breakdown page, not per-card computation.

### Critical Files for Implementation

- `/Users/sakshammittal/Documents/360ghar/github/360ghar/360-flatmates-web/docs/flatmates-openapi.yaml` -- The OpenAPI 3.1.0 spec with all 38 endpoints and 70+ schemas; source of truth for type generation and API client implementation
- `/Users/sakshammittal/Documents/360ghar/github/360ghar/360-flatmates/DESIGN.md` -- Complete design system (color tokens, typography, components, animations, screen-by-screen specs) that must be faithfully ported to web CSS/Tailwind
- `/Users/sakshammittal/Documents/360ghar/github/360ghar/360-flatmates/docs/prd.md` -- Product requirements document with personas, user modes, onboarding flow, core features, chat system, trust and safety, and feature priority matrix
- `/Users/sakshammittal/Documents/360ghar/github/360ghar/360-flatmates/docs/flatmates_technical_spec.md` -- Backend architecture, data model, API surface, chat/match behavior, and catalog strategy; informs the API integration layer design
- `/Users/sakshammittal/Documents/360ghar/github/360ghar/360-flatmates/CLAUDE.md` -- Mobile architecture patterns (Riverpod state, GoRouter, Dio interceptors, error handling, shared component library) that inform web equivalents

---

## Verification

1. **Type Generation**: Run `openapi-typescript docs/flatmates-openapi.yaml -o lib/api/types.ts` and verify no errors
2. **Auth Flow**: Test phone OTP login -> bootstrap -> onboarding redirect -> home feed cycle
3. **Public SEO**: Verify listing pages are indexable (view page source, check meta tags, JSON-LD, canonical URLs)
4. **SSE Connection**: Verify real-time events flow (new message appears in chat, match notification shows toast)
5. **Swipe Deck**: Test keyboard shortcuts (Left/Right/Up), mouse drag, expanded drawer
6. **Responsive**: Test at 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1280px (desktop), 1440px (wide)
7. **Dark Mode**: Toggle dark mode, verify all pages render with warm charcoal palette
8. **Lighthouse**: Run Lighthouse audit, verify LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
9. **Accessibility**: Run axe audit, verify no WCAG 2.1 AA violations
10. **API Integration**: Verify all 43 endpoints are callable with correct auth, pagination, and error handling
