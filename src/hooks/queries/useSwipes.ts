 *   3. On success, we do NOT invalidate the deck. The optimistic removal is
 *      the source of truth. The `onNearEnd` refill mechanism (already wired in
 *      SwipeDeck) handles fetching new pages when the deck is running low.
 *      We also skip refetching to avoid the "card stuck" bug where a per-swipe
 *      refetch raced with the exit animation and caused the index to reset or
 *      the deck to repeat stale cards.
