/**
 * Build-time prerendering for the 360 Flatmates SPA.
 *
 * Runs AFTER `vite build`. Serves the built dist/ with `vite preview`, launches
 * headless Chromium (imported from `@playwright/test`, which is already a
 * devDependency and ships/installs its browser via the e2e workflow), navigates
 * to each public route, waits for the app to render + react-helmet-async to
 * flush meta/JSON-LD, then writes the fully-rendered HTML to dist/<route>/index.html
 * (or dist/index.html for "/"). Real files on disk take precedence over the
 * SPA fallback ("/* /index.html 200" in _redirects), so crawlers that do not
 * run JS (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, CCBot, Applebot, Meta-ExternalAgent, ...) get real
 * HTML with real meta, JSON-LD, and visible content.
 *
 * Route coverage mirrors `scripts/generate-sitemap.ts` exactly: static public
 * routes, every supported city, every neighborhood, and every discoverable
 * listing page (`/discover/:id`, `/share/:id`) from the shared build-time fetch
 * in `scripts/lib/listings.ts`. Sharing that fetch guarantees the sitemap never
 * advertises a URL that this step has not rendered.
 *
 * Robustness:
 *  - A single route failure logs a warning and continues; the build never fails
 *    because of one flaky route.
 *  - Listing prerendering is the build-time-expensive part (one page per
 *    listing). Set `PRERENDER_LISTINGS=0` to skip it; otherwise it runs with a
 *    bounded concurrency (PRERENDER_CONCURRENCY, default 4) to keep build time
 *    sane. Route counts are logged up front so the scale is visible.
 *  - Infrastructure failures (no dist/, preview server won't start, Chromium
 *    can't launch) DO fail the build — if the step cannot run at all there is
 *    nothing to degrade gracefully to. Per-route failures never reach that path.
 *
 * Environment: Vite inlines VITE_* vars from .env into the built bundle at
 * `vite build` time, so the served bundle already contains valid Supabase/API
 * config and validateEnv() in entry.tsx passes. No extra env is needed for a
 * local build that has .env. In CI, ensure the VITE_* vars are present in the
 * build environment, and that `npx playwright install chromium` has run (the
 * e2e workflow already does this; a build-only job must too).
